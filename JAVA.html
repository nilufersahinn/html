        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(59, 71, 71); text-align: left; width: 700px; height: 50px;">
                In June 1991, James Gosling and Patrick Naughton laid the foundation for the Java project. Initially designed for interactive televisions, 
            Java was ahead of its time in the digital cable industry and wasn't widely used in that area.
            The current name and logo of Java came about quite spontaneously. The language was first named Oak because of the oak tree outside Gosling’s office. 
            Later, the project name became "Green" because the project team at Sun Microsystems in 1991 was called the "Green Team." 
            Eventually, the name settled on "Java" because the project team consumed a lot of coffee from the Java Island in Indonesia. It's not surprising that 
            programmers are so influenced by coffee consumption. In 1995, Java 1.0 was released, and in 1998, Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.2 was launched, introducing the Swing library, 
            the Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler, the Collections Framework, and more. Swing is built on top of AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and provides components such as buttons offered by the JButton class, 
            text fields, table components, and more. The Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler speeds up the application by converting Java bytecode into native machine code at runtime.
            The Collections Framework provides classes like 'ArrayList,' 'HashSet,' and 'HashMap' which are used to solve algorithms in subsequent processes. 
            This framework offers a common API (Application Programming Interface) for data structures, allowing applications to communicate with each other. In 2006, Sun Microsystems made Java open source, 
            which brought community contributions, innovation, widespread acceptance and use, cost savings, transparency, and reliability to Java. 
            Today, we know that Java continues to be developed by Oracle Corporation, which acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010.
